# 🌸 Petal-Based Merit System: The Semantic Health Bar for Ideas

Welcome to the Meritocious Petal System—a visual, emotional, and semantic representation of how ideas **grow**, **evolve**, and **blossom**.

Inspired by nature, gamified health bars (like Link's hearts in *Ocarina of Time*), and the slow, visible unfolding of thought, each post visually displays its **Merit Score** as a growing **flower** made of **fractional petals**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🪷 Petals = Merit
Each petal represents **1 full unit of merit**, with visual segments for:

- ¼ petal = 0.25
- ½ petal = 0.5
- ¾ petal = 0.75
- 🌸 full petal = 1.0

> Posts gradually “bloom” as they gain merit and inspire others.

### 🔄 Recursive Growth

Merit is earned through both **direct contribution** and **influence**:

| Source | Description | Petal Bonus |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 🌱 Base Merit | Clarity, novelty, insight, etc. | Up to 8 petals |
| 🌿 Direct Forks | High-quality forks | +0.25 to 0.5 per fork |
| 🔁 Remixes | Synthesis/remix across ideas | +0.5 per remix |
| 👶 Grandchildren | Forks of forks (descendants) | +0.25 each (capped) |
| 🌐 Bloom Chains | Remixes across multiple subbranches | +1 glow effect |

---

## 🧩 Visual Representation

- Each flower has a max of **16 petals** (adjustable cap)
- Petals display in **¼ increments**, filling clockwise
- Posts with max bloom enter **Radiant Bloom** status:
  - Subtle animation
  - Listed in “🌺 Most Bloomed” section
  - Eligible for remix lineage map

### Example Display:

**Petals**: 11.75 / 16  
**Visual**: 11 full petals + ¾ glowing petal

## 🛠 Data Schema Example (JSON)

```json
{
  "post_id": 2048,
  "title": "Draco, the Muggleborn",
  "base_merit": 6.25,
  "fork_bonus": 3.5,
  "remix_bonus": 2.0,
  "descendant_count": 12,
  "total_petals": 11.75,
  "bloom_status": "radiant",
  "petal_display": "11¾"
}
```

## 🔍 Petal Details (On Hover/Expand)

Each petal reveals the **dimension of merit** it represents:

| Petal Type | Represents |
|------------|------------|
| 💡 Clarity | Precision of language, logical structure |
| 🌱 Novelty | Originality, reframing, conceptual creativity |
| 🧠 Insight Depth | Layered or profound reasoning |
| 🔄 Remixability | How easily it can be forked/remixed |
| 🤝 Constructiveness | Adds value, builds on others |
| 🧵 Interconnectivity | Links or relates to other threads |
| 📚 Reference Strength | Citations, ideas integrated from other sources |
| 🧬 Lineage Impact | Number and quality of forks/remixes it inspired |

---

## 🧭 Bonus Ideas

- **Wilting State**: Petals fade for outdated or low-engagement posts (can be revived!)
- **Grafting**: Merge petals from two ideas into a new hybrid bloom
- **Petal Trails**: Follow lineage backwards to see what seeded an idea
- **Bloom Quests**: Curated prompts where ideas “compete to bloom”

---

## 🌺 Why It Works

✅ Intuitive visual for contribution  
✅ Encourages meaningful forks & remixes  
✅ Makes abstract merit feel tactile and alive  
✅ Turns discourse into **growth**, not performance  
✅ Reinforces the core ethos: *Where Ideas Blossom*

> *Ideas don’t go viral here. They go botanical.*
