ðŸ”€ Forking Philosophy on Meritocious
Can forks be merged?
No. Merges imply unificationâ€”and on Meritocious, divergence is a feature, not a flaw.

Forks are designed to represent unique, branching paths of thought. Once a fork is created, it stands on its own. It might agree with, challenge, extend, or remix its sourceâ€”but it remains independent.

That said, users are encouraged to create new forks inspired by multiple posts. These synthesis forks are not merges in the traditional sense, but rather combinatorial ideas that acknowledge and build on more than one source.

Divergence is not a dead endâ€”itâ€™s a starting point for higher-order thinking.

This design preserves intellectual plurality, fosters creative exploration, and avoids premature consensus.
