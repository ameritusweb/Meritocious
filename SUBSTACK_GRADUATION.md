# 🌱 Substack Evolution & Graduation System

Meritocious is built to let ideas evolve organically. Substacks don’t start as gated communities—they **emerge naturally** from meaningful patterns of discussion. This document outlines how tags evolve into **Auto-Beta Substacks**, and how the community votes to **graduate** them into full substacks.

---

## 🔁 Substack Lifecycle Overview

```
[Tag] → [Auto-Beta Substack] → [Graduation Vote] → [Permanent Substack]
                                  ↓
                         [Stays in Beta] or [Archived]
```

## 🧬 Phase 1: Tag Phase (Proto-Substack)

Any post can use **tags**. Some tags, over time, become strong enough to suggest a new thematic space is emerging.

### 📈 Promotion Criteria:
A tag becomes an **Auto-Beta Substack** when it meets all of these:

- ✅ At least **10 unique posts** using the tag  
- ✅ An average **merit score ≥ 7.0** across those posts  
- ✅ At least **5 distinct contributors**  
- ✅ Posts using the tag appear in **2 or more existing substacks**  

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: Auto-Beta Substack

When the threshold is reached, the system automatically creates a **Beta Substack** with:

- A generated **title** and **description** based on post clustering
- A collection of existing posts tagged accordingly
- A listing in the UI under the section: **“🌱 Growing Ideas”**
- A basic **"beta" status badge** in the header

### ✍️ Community Editing:
Contributors can propose:
- Substack mission statement
- Logo/icon
- Tag refinements or splits

---

## 🗳️ Phase 3: Graduation Vote

After 30 days of activity (or other configurable period), the substack becomes eligible for graduation.

### 🎓 Graduation Requirements:
- 🧠 20+ total posts in the Substack
- 🌟 100+ cumulative merit score
- 👥 At least 10 unique contributors
- 📜 A community-drafted mission statement is submitted

### 🗳️ Voting Process:
- Voting is open to users with **merit score ≥ 50**
- 3 options:
  - ✅ Graduate to permanent Substack
  - 🧪 Stay in Beta (needs more time)
  - 🚫 Merge with or deprecate (too niche or redundant)

- **Passing Threshold:**  
  - ≥ 75% approval from **20+ eligible voters**

---

## 💤 If It Doesn’t Graduate

If the vote fails:
- It remains in beta and can be retried later
- If **no new posts in 60 days**, it is auto-archived
  - Still viewable
  - Can be revived if interest resurges

---

## 🧱 Design Goals

- 🌿 **Organic Growth** – Communities emerge naturally from participation
- 🧭 **Democratic Control** – Users with high-merit reputations shape the ecosystem
- 🧠 **Semantic Cohesion** – Prevents topic fragmentation and echo chambers
- 📊 **LLM-Friendly Architecture** – Works with vector-based clustering and ranking

---

## 🧩 Future Features (Optional)

- “📈 Trending Tags” area for watching potential beta candidates
- Substack **lineage metadata**:
  - `forked_from: Tech + Society`
  - `origin_tag: "AI in Agriculture"`
- Visual **Substack Graph** view for navigating forks, merges, and evolutions

---

## 🧠 Example Scenario

> The tag `#AI in Agriculture` appears in 24 posts across 3 substacks, with a 7.9 average merit. 12 unique contributors have used it.  
> The system automatically promotes it to a Beta Substack called **“AI in Agriculture”**.  
> After a month of high activity, the community votes 84% in favor of graduation.  
> It becomes a permanent part of the Meritocious idea ecosystem.
