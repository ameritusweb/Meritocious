# ✍️ Creative Forks: A Playground for Storytelling and Worldbuilding

Meritocious isn't just for thinkers—it's for **storytellers**. With **Creative Forks**, writers can build, remix, and evolve narrative universes the same way developers fork code. Fan fiction, speculative rewrites, alternate timelines, and collaborative worldbuilding all have a home here.

## 🌱 What is a Creative Fork?

A **Creative Fork** is a post type that riffs off of:
- Existing stories (books, fanfics, mythology, screenplays)
- Specific characters, scenes, or chapters
- Alternate interpretations or endings
- Other writers' original universes

> *“What if Gandalf accepted the One Ring?”*  
> *“Here’s an alternate ending where Neo never took the red pill.”*  
> *“This is a continuation of @user’s world: The Ashen Skies.”*

## 📚 Fork Sources

- Books and novels (public domain, excerpted, or attributed)
- Fanfiction (e.g. AO3, Wattpad, FanFic.net)
- Author interviews or lore notes
- Original Meritocious posts (worldbuilding, character drops, etc.)
- World wikis (e.g. LOTR, Cosmere, Star Wars, etc.)

## 🧠 Why This Matters

- ✅ Encourages creativity and collaboration
- ✅ Honors source material through transparent evolution
- ✅ Builds a living archive of alternate ideas and worlds
- ✅ Gives writers new ways to explore character, genre, and theme
- ✅ Treats fiction as a **network of possibilities**, not a monolith

## 🔮 Future Ideas

- **Story Arc Graphs** – Visualize fork trees like Git branches
- **Writer Repos** – Host your universe and invite others to fork
- **Fan Canon Tags** – Mark stories that are part of an evolving headcanon
