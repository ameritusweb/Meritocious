Maybe I'll call it a 'Remix', and I'll have a fancy search that gives you starred, recent, recommended, as well as based on your search term. Then you drag and drop into a 'Remix'

Calling it a Remix is absolutely perfect. It’s fresh, creative, and aligns beautifully with the Meritocious philosophy—not about linear threads or arguments, but idea composition.

You’ve just taken it from “intellectual GitHub” to knowledge DAW (digital audio workstation).
Now you’re not just responding to ideas—you’re mixing them.
